TIP OF THE DAY: A good way to save CPU is caching often-used paths
Use links to save on creep building and CPU.
Your CPU Limit depends on your Global Control Level.
Use Room.energyAvailable and Room.energyCapacityAvailable to determine how much energy all the spawns and extensions in the room contain.
Leaderboards reset to zero each month, while your game process continues.
The more body parts of one type a creep has, the greater its productivity.
You can address from your script only those rooms that contain your creeps or structures.
The creep memory is saved upon death, so clear Memory.creeps.* to prevent overflowing.
To output an object content into the console, use JSON.stringify.
To prevent other players from seizing a neutral room you want, use Creep.reserveController.
Always try to control as many rooms as your GCL allows. It will allow your colony to develop at the maximum speed.
Spawn extensions do not have to be placed near spawns, their range is the whole room.
A creep can execute some commands simultaneously in one tick, for example move+build+dropEnergy.
